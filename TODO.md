## TODO List

### Very soon:
- Handle errors in executor instead in every command
- Better SDL header for header files

### Planned:
- resize elements on window resize
- Check whats causing when camera goes way too much down it goes back to beggining but keeping offset
- Dialogues rects in dialogues cpp instead of main and inventory*
- tp cam, tp player cmds
- getcampos, getplayerpos, getplayercolor cmd
- terminalmode
- better saving (presets, colors, etc)
- Switch instead of ifs in inventory::Overlay() color pickers
- Colors in block textures
- Fix variable names (uppercase words) in savemap.cpp
- Make quick color picker pick block texture too
- Add textureId to presets
- setblocktexture, getblocktexture cmds
- add to place cmd texture argument
- make debug thing that prints whole settings struct and maybe all others
- Autosave
- Docs
- Colorpicker, texturepicker, overlay got textcolor var

### Thinking:
- shadows
- Switch statement in events
- Is mouse down check in seperate file
- undo/redo
(temponary memory to revert accidental clicks/missclicks, got idea for last placed block undo/redo, thinking abt bigger limit) | note for me: arrays?
- multiple save slots
- Custom color pallete
- move player color with colors // in save // in settings and add saving preset ability

### Explanations:
- Very soon - priority, most likely coming next few updates
- Planned   - will probably add it to this
- Thinking  - 50/50, has chance to come to game
