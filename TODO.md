## TODO List
### This list conatins stuff that I might add in game - Feel free to [suggest stuff](https://github.com/Mikicrepstudios/Random-SDL-Game/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- - After updating to newer MF version, add to changelogs that button hover effect is now weaker
- Core

- - Autosave - save after n of placed blocks OR n time (not decided)
- - Way to save and load while inside of game
- - Different world map sizes?
- - Blocks with gravity
- Commands
- Files
- - Multiple save slots
- Graphics
- - Change hover to be either transparent or just darker color of block
- - Hotbar drawn at bottom for block presets
- - Replace "solid" flip flop switch to allow other kind of blocks too instead of it only, rename to "Block type"

### Thinking:
