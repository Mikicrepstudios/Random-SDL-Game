## TODO List

### Very soon:

### Planned:
- block textures
(overlay on block to make it seem like it got texture)
- no collision block
(block where player got ability to go thru it)
- Bool canPlayerPlace
if no then player cannot place blocks if yes player can, i need this to organize code bit better
- resize elements on window resize
- Include width, height, fullscreen, colors in gameInfo
- move player color with colors // in save // in settings and add saving preset ability
- bool cheats & int cheatId
- namespace for colorpicker

### Thinking:
- shadows
- Switch statement in events
- Is mouse down check in seperate file
- undo/redo
(temponary memory to revert accidental clicks/missclicks, got idea for last placed block undo/redo, thinking abt bigger limit) | note for me: arrays?
- multiple save slots
- Custom color pallete
- Dialogues rects in dialogues cpp instead of main
- Rename camera to cam

### Explanations:
- Very soon - priority, most likely coming next few updates
- Planned   - will probably add it to this
- Thinking  - 50/50, has chance to come to game
