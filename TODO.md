## TODO List

### Very soon:
- Struct of all settings
- Player struct

### Planned:
- undo/redo
(temponary memory to revert accidental clicks/missclicks, got idea for last placed block undo/redo, thinking abt bigger limit)
- block textures
(overlay on block to make it seem like it got texture)
- no collision block
(block where player got ability to go thru it)
- Are you sure you want to exit (on ESC)
exit with/o saving cancel
- Are you sure you want to clear canvas (on c)
yes no

### Thinking:
- shadows
- 32bit windows support

### Explanations:
- Very soon - priority, most likely coming next few updates
- Planned   - will probably add it to this
- Thinking  - 50/50, has chance to come to game
