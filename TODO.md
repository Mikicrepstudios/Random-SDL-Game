# TODO List

## Very soon:
- Rename draw::DrawPreview to draw::DrawRect
- Struct of all settings
- Player struct

## Planned:
- undo/redo
(temponary memory to revert accidental clicks/missclicks, got idea for last placed block undo/redo, thinking abt bigger limit)
- block textures
(overlay on block to make it seem like it got texture)
- no collision block
(block where player got ability to go thru it)

## Thinking:
-  shadows

### Explanations:
- Very soon - priority, most likely coming next few updates
- Planned   - will probably add it to this
- Thinking  - 50/50, has chance to come to game
