## TODO List

### Very soon:

### Planned:
- block textures
(overlay on block to make it seem like it got texture)
- no collision block
(block where player got ability to go thru it)
if no then player cannot place blocks if yes player can, i need this to organize code bit better
- resize elements on window resize
- move player color with colors // in save // in settings and add saving preset ability
- make extra if for settings.cheats instead of having in every cheat settings.cheats and switch for cheatId
- make all cheats functions into int and return 1 when completed, if returned 1 turn off highlight and cheats bool outside of actual function
- Check whats causing when camera goes way too much down it goes back to beggining but keeping offset
- Split inventory fucnctions into multiple files
- Dialogues rects in dialogues cpp instead of main and inventory*

### Thinking:
- shadows
- Switch statement in events
- Is mouse down check in seperate file
- undo/redo
(temponary memory to revert accidental clicks/missclicks, got idea for last placed block undo/redo, thinking abt bigger limit) | note for me: arrays?
- multiple save slots
- Custom color pallete

### Explanations:
- Very soon - priority, most likely coming next few updates
- Planned   - will probably add it to this
- Thinking  - 50/50, has chance to come to game
