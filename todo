/*--- TODO List ---*/
## Very soon:
- camerapos cheat
(click key, enable mode where u click anywhere and that sets cameras position)
- playerpos cheat
(same for camerapos cheat but for player)
- color pickup tool
(mode where u click any block and it selects that block color)

## Planned:
- undo/redo
(temponary memory to revert accidental clicks/missclicks, got idea for last placed block undo/redo, thinking abt bigger limit)
- block textures
(overlay on block to make it seem like it got texture)
- no collision block
(block where player got ability to go thru it)
- cleanup unused includes (if theres any)

## Thinking:
- particles
(on destroyed block???)
- power ups
(player pickupable objects put on surface layer???)

### Format:
- feature - rank
(description/s if any)
### Explanations:
- Very soon - priority, most likely coming next few updates
- Planned   - will probably add it to this
- Thinking  - 50/50, has chance to come to game
