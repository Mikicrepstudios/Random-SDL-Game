# Random SDL Game
- by Mikicrep

Most random game/game engine I made where I just put most random features. You can post suggestions in Mikicrep Studios discord server.

## Requirements
```pacman -S --needed base-devel sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image```

This command only works on arch based linux distros, for other ones you gotta find coresponding packages

### Another goal of this thing is to be able to run on potato.
