# Random SDL Game
- by Mikicrep

Most random game/game engine I made where I just put most random features. You can post suggestions in Mikicrep Studios discord server.

## Requirements
```pacman -S --needed base-devel sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image```

This command only works on arch based linux distros, for other ones you gotta find coresponding packages

## Compiling and running
1. Clone this repo
2. Open terminal and run `make`
- You can move `output` folder out of repo folder and delete repo folder
- You can delete .md files too but do not delete anything else

### Runs on potato.
