    <div class="shrink">
      <ol>
        <li>Object callbacks can currently only have one argument due to the way that they are encoded.</li>
        <li>Strings are still pushed onto the stack as raw pointers. They simply point to the string in the code.</li>
        <li>Library files as well as regular MegaScript files don't load correctly on Windows.</li>
        <li>Error catching is not entirely finished. Some errors may freeze the program, or cause a segmentation fault.</li>
